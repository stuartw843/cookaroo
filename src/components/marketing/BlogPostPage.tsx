    content: `# 10 Essential Tips for Meal Planning Success

Meal planning doesn't have to be overwhelming. Here are the essential tips to get you started:

## 1. Start Small
Begin with planning just 3-4 meals per week instead of trying to plan everything at once.

## 2. Use What You Have
Check your pantry and fridge before planning new meals to reduce waste and save money.

## 3. Theme Nights
Assign themes like "Meatless Monday" or "Taco Tuesday" to make planning easier.

## 4. Prep Ingredients
Wash, chop, and store ingredients in advance to save time during busy weeknights.

## 5. Keep a Running List
Note family favorites for easy planning in future weeks.

With Cookaroo's meal planning features, you can easily organize your weekly meals and keep track of your family's favorite recipes.`,

    excerpt: "Master the art of scaling recipes up or down for any number of servings with these essential tips and techniques.",
    content: `# Scaling Recipes: A Complete Guide

Scaling recipes correctly ensures consistent results every time.

## Basic Scaling Rules
- Multiply all ingredients by the same factor
- Be careful with spices and seasonings (start with less)
- Consider cooking time adjustments for larger batches
- Account for pan size and cooking vessel changes

## Ingredients That Don't Scale Linearly
- Salt and spices (increase gradually)
- Leavening agents (baking powder, yeast)
- Thickeners (flour, cornstarch)
- Alcohol in cooking

Modern recipe apps can automatically calculate scaled ingredients, taking the guesswork out of cooking for different group sizes.`,
